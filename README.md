Chronos is a self-hosted time tracking and activity analytics platform designed for developers and teams who want full control over their data. It automatically records coding activity across projects, machines, and environments, turning raw usage events into clear, actionable insights.

With a secure API, per-machine authentication, and detailed breakdowns by language, project, and time range, Chronos makes it easy to understand where time is spent without relying on third-party services. Built with performance, extensibility, and privacy in mind, it integrates seamlessly into existing workflows while remaining fully customizable.

Chronos is ideal for individuals and teams who value transparency, ownership, and flexibility in how their productivity data is collected and analyzed.
